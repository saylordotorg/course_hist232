**Unit 6: The Iranian Revolution** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, we will examine the origins of the Islamic Revolution and
then take a look at social and political life in Iran under Ayatollah
Khomeini’s rule. We will also discuss how the Iranian Revolution
destabilized the nations of the Middle East and Southwest Asia and led
to religious and political turmoil throughout the region in the
following decades. Following World War I, Iran attempted to maintain
political independence from European imperial authority, but British
investments in Iran’s oil industry gave Great Britain significant
control over Iran’s economy and politics. After World War II, Iranian
voters elected Mohammed Mossadegh as prime minister. Once in power,
Mossadegh began nationalizing Iran’s oil industry. In response, the
British and American governments instigated Mossadegh’s overthrow and
placed autocratic ruler Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in charge of the
country. The Shah supported modernization and secularization of Iranian
society and brutally suppressed political and religious opponents. In
1978, strikes and demonstrations against the Shah’s rule led to the
Iranian Revolution. The Shah fled Iran, and a theocratic council
appointed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as the new supreme religious
leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran.*
