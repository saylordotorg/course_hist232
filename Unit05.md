**Unit 5: Political, Economic, and Social Tensions in the 1960s and
1970s** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit will look at the sources of political, economic, and social
tensions in the Middle East and Southwest Asia during the 1960s and
1970s and examine how these tensions shaped the development of countries
in the region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>We will also
analyze the results of modernization campaigns in these nations and look
at how these campaigns altered the place of women and religious
minorities in Middle Eastern society.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>The 1960s and 1970s were an era of political, economic, and
social instability for many nations in the Middle East and Southwest
Asia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Nations such as Turkey,
Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon experimented with elected governments
during this time period, but military officials and autocratic leaders
seized power in many of these countries after electoral chaos and
violence threatened social and political stability.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Libya, Iraq, Iran, and the Arabian
states profited from oil production, but unstable oil prices prevented
them from earning consistent revenues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>In 1965, these Middle Eastern states, along with nations in South
America, Africa, and Asia, formed the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to control oil production and stabilize
international oil prices.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Over
the course of the 1970s, OPEC began to exert greater power
internationally.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Some Middle
Eastern OPEC nations also used oil as an economic weapon when they
embargoed oil shipments to the United States after it supported Israel
in the 1973 Yom Kippur War.*
