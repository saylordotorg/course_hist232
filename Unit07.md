**Unit 7: Secular and Religious Tensions in the 1980s and 1990s** <span
id="7"></span> 
*In this unit, we will examine how the major conflicts of the 1980s and
early 1990s destabilized the nations of the Middle East and contributed
to the emergence of militant Islamic fundamentalist movements that
objected to western influences in the region and supported a return to
strict theocratic Islamic rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>A
series of military and political struggles shaped the economic and
political development of the Middle East and Southwest Asia in the 1980s
and 1990s.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>In 1979, Soviet
military forces swept across the border of Afghanistan and seized
political control of the country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>Afghani resistance fighters backed by the United States and other
Middle Eastern nations gradually began to chip away at the Soviet
military forces and eventually forced the USSR to withdraw its forces
from Afghanistan in 1988.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>A year
after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
took advantage of the chaos of the Iranian Revolution and attacked
western Iran.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>The Iran-Iraq War,
which ended the same year as the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan,
cost the lives of nearly a million Iranians and half a million
Iraqis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>During this same time
period, Israel faced domestic terrorist attacks by members of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, a political movement that supported
an independent Palestinian state.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>Finally, in 1990, the United States became directly involved in a
military conflict in Iraq and Kuwait after Saddam Hussein invaded the
latter country.*
