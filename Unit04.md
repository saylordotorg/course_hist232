**Unit 4: The Cold War in the Middle East** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, we will examine how the Cold War shaped political and
economic development in the Middle East and Southwest Asia during the
1950s and early 1960s.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>We will
also look at how the nations of the region attempted to create stable
governments and economic systems in the postcolonial period.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Following World War II, all the former
mandate territories of the Middle East and Southwest Asia gained their
political independence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>While
these states were no longer under direct European political control,
they continued to struggle under the economic, political, and social
legacy of European imperialism.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>Some states, such as Egypt, attempted to nationalize European
corporations in order to gain economic control of these companies.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>In 1956, Egypt’s efforts to
nationalize the Suez Canal Corporation led to an armed conflict with
Britain and France.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>The growing
Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union also had a
profound impact on the region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>The Americans and the Soviets used economic and military aid to
secure friendships and political alliances with nations in the
region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>The United States
supported Israel and other pro-Western states, while the USSR provided
aid to Israel’s Arab enemies.*

    lays out what subsequently became known as the “Eisenhower
    Doctrine.” At the end of World War II, a new war—the Cold War—was
    unleashed between the United States and the Soviet Union and its
    satellite states.  This conflict manifested itself in the Middle

    democracy and Communism.  In this speech, President Eisenhower
    describes U.S. foreign policy toward the Middle East: to preserve
    the independence of new Middle Eastern states while also protecting
    them from Communist Russia.
