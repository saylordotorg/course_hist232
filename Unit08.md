id="8"></span> 
*In this final unit, we will examine some of the key developmental
challenges that nations in the Middle East and Southwest Asia face
today.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>We will also look at the
growing tensions between secular Islamic states and supporters of
Islamic fundamentalism.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Finally,
we will examine the role that such external political agents as the
United States and the European Union continue to play in the development
of the region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Middle Eastern and
Southwest Asian nations continue to struggle with political, economic,
and social problems in the 21st century.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>Many of these nations remain economically underdeveloped and
continue to depend on oil revenues as their major source of income.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>American military involvement in Iraq
and Afghanistan has further inflamed regional tension and has encouraged
militant Islamic fundamentalist movements, such as al-Qaeda, to plot
terrorist attacks on American allies in the region.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>In Iran, conflicts between political
moderates and extremists boiled over during the aftermath of the 2009
presidential elections.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>For
nations with a tradition of democratic rule, such as Israel and Turkey,
the first decade of the 21st century has been a period of economic
success tempered by internal ethnic and social unrest.*
