**Unit 1: Imperialism and Indpendence** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, we will examine how European nations exercised political
control over the former Ottoman territories and shaped the political and
social development of these states as part of their broader empires.  We
will also look at how the inhabitants of these states responded to
European imperial rule and how the growth of independence movements in
the Middle East and Southwest Asia threatened European control over the
region.  At the end of World War I, Great Britain and France oversaw the
dismantling of the defeated Ottoman Empire.  The covenant of the new
League of Nations mandated that Britain and France administer and advise
the former Ottoman territories in the Middle East “until such time as
they are able to stand alone.”  In practice, these “mandate territories”
became extensions of the colonial empires of Britain and France.  During
the 1920s and 1930s, colonial administrators controlled the internal
political affairs of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Transjordan,
Egypt, and Libya.  Only Turkey and Iran exercised significant political
independence from European domination.*
