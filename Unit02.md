**Unit 2: Economic Devlopment** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will examine how the Middle East and Southwest Asia
developed economically during the Interwar Period and how European
economic imperialism left a lasting impression on the economic structure
of the region.  We will also examine the economic and political impact
of World War II on the Middle East and how the war eventually led to
independence for many of the mandate territories.  In addition to
administering political affairs in the mandate territories of the Middle
East, Europeans played a major role in the region’s economic development
prior to World War II.  European firms established subsidiary
corporations throughout the region to explore for oil and other natural
resources.  The mandate territories also served as markets for European
manufactured goods.  European investors were responsible for road and
railroad construction projects as well as many other internal
improvements.  European control of the local economy bred resentment in
many states because local businesses could not compete with powerful
European subsidiaries.  This growing resentment contributed to the
emergence of nationalist movements in many of the mandate territories by
the beginning of World War II.*
