**Unit 3: Zionism and the Creation of Israel** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we will examine the origins and the development of the
State of Israel and look at the uneasy relationship between Israel and
its Arab neighbors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>We will also
ask how the creation of Israel impacted the lives of Palestinian
inhabitants in the region and forced many to flee Israel and take up
residence in massive refugee camps in surrounding nations.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>The Zionist movement began in the late
19th century as a response to extreme anti-Semitism in Europe.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Zionist leaders promoted the creation
of a Jewish state in Palestine, the traditional homeland of the Jewish
people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Near the end of World War
I, the British government publicly supported this plan in what became
known as the Balfour Declaration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>During the 1920s and 1930s, Jewish immigrants began settling in
Palestine and purchasing property for local landlords.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>As their numbers began to swell,
tensions arose with local Arab inhabitants.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>British colonial administrators
attempted to maintain peace in Palestine and impose limits on Jewish
immigration, but the policy was only partially successful.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>At the end of World War II, a massive
wave of Jewish settlers—many of them Holocaust victims—began arriving in
Palestine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>By 1947, the United
Nations recommended that part of Palestine become a Jewish state.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>The following year, Jewish leaders
announced the creation of the State of Israel.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>They immediately faced an invasion by
the armies of the Arab nations surrounding Israel.*
